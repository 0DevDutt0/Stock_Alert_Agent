Subject: Portfolio Project - Stock Agent (Python/FastAPI)

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I wanted to share a recent project that demonstrates my backend development skills:

Stock Agent - An autonomous stock monitoring system with real-time alerts
GitHub: https://github.com/[your-username]/stock-agent

Key highlights:
✓ Production-ready FastAPI application with clean architecture
✓ 80%+ test coverage with comprehensive unit and integration tests
✓ Docker deployment with CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
✓ Professional documentation (README, Architecture, Contributing guides)
✓ Type-safe with Pydantic models and mypy validation

The project showcases:
• Backend API development (FastAPI, RESTful design)
• Software architecture (layered design, SOLID principles)
• Testing & quality assurance (pytest, coverage reporting)
• DevOps practices (Docker, CI/CD, deployment automation)
• Technical documentation

I'd be happy to discuss the technical decisions and architecture in more detail.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## 🎬 Demo Script (For Interviews)

```
"Let me walk you through Stock Agent:

1. PROBLEM: Investors need to monitor stock prices constantly, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

2. SOLUTION: I built an autonomous agent that monitors stocks 24/7 and sends Telegram alerts when targets are reached.

3. ARCHITECTURE: 
   - API Layer: FastAPI with versioned endpoints (/api/v1/)
   - Service Layer: Business logic (stock analysis, market data, alerts)
   - Repository Layer: Data persistence with easy database migration path
   - This separation makes it testable, maintainable, and scalable

4. QUALITY:
   - 80%+ test coverage with unit and integration tests
   - CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically on every commit
   - Type safety with Pydantic and mypy
   - Structured logging for observability

5. DEPLOYMENT:
   - Dockerized for consistent environments
   - One-command deployment with docker-compose
   - Health check endpoints for monitoring
   - Ready for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)

6. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Database migration (currently JSON, designed for PostgreSQL)
   - Web dashboard with React
   - Machine learning for price predictions
   - Multi-user support with authentication

The project demonstrates my ability to build production-ready systems, not just prototypes."
